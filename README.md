## The Problem We Solve

### The "Logic-to-Code Gap" in Covenant Monitoring

When a **$1 billion syndicated loan** is issued across 15 banks, someone must monitor whether the borrower is complying with financial covenants every quarter.

**Today's painful reality:**

| Who                      | What They Do                              | Time Spent              |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Borrower**             | Builds Excel to calculate covenants       | 4 hours/quarter         |
| **Agent Bank**           | Manually verifies borrower's calculations | 4 hours/quarter         |
| **15 Participant Banks** | Each recalculates independently           | 3 hours each = 45 hours |
| **Total**                | Duplicated manual work                    | **49 hours per loan**   |

> _This is called "stare and compare"—analysts stare at PDFs and Excel sheets, manually translating legal text into formulas._

**The real problem isn't bad UX or missing dashboards.**

**The problem is:** Every covenant definition is written in legal English, but compliance requires math. Someone must manually translate:

```
"Net Debt to EBITDA shall not exceed 4.0x"
```

into:

```
=IF(B2/B3 <= 4.0, "COMPLIANT", "BREACH")
```

This translation happens **manually, for every loan, every quarter.** It's slow, error-prone, and duplicated across all 15+ banks in a syndicate.

## Our Solution

### AI reads the contract. AI writes the code. Humans verify and sign.

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐

      30 seconds            10 seconds              Instant
```

**Before:** 49 hours of manual work across the syndicate.  
**After:** 10 minutes. Same result. Zero discrepancies.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Document Upload

Upload any LMA-standard loan agreement PDF. Our AI finds Section 22 (Definitions) and extracts all covenant clauses automatically.

### 2. AI Covenant Extraction

We use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to understand complex covenant definitions including:

- EBITDA calculation with add-backs and caps
- Senior Leverage and Total Leverage ratios
- Interest Coverage and Fixed Charge Coverage
- CapEx limits and other financial covenants

### 3. Automatic Code Generation

The AI converts legal definitions into executable Python code. No more Excel formula errors. The code is:

- **Transparent** — Banks can read and audit the logic
- **Deterministic** — Same inputs = same outputs, always
- **Shareable** — All syndicate members use identical calculations

### 4. Real-Time Compliance Testing

Input your quarterly financials and get instant pass/fail results with detailed breakdowns for each covenant.

### 5. LMA-Compliant Certificate Generation

Generate professional, audit-ready compliance certificates in the exact format required by Schedule 8 of LMA agreements. Ready for digital signature and submission.

## How It Works (User Flow)

### Step 1: Upload Agreement

Drag and drop your LMA loan agreement PDF. The system securely stores it and prepares for analysis.

### Step 2: AI Extraction

Our AI reads the document, finds all covenant definitions, and extracts them with their limits and calculation formulas.

### Step 3: Review & Edit

Verify the extracted covenants. Make any necessary edits—you're always in control.

### Step 4: Generate Code

The system automatically generates executable Python code that implements your exact covenant calculations.

### Step 5: Calculate Compliance

Enter your quarterly financials. The system runs the calculations and shows pass/fail status for each covenant.

### Step 6: Sign & Download

Review results, apply your digital signature, and download a professional PDF compliance certificate.

## Example: How We Solve the "EBITDA Problem"

### The Challenge

A typical EBITDA definition in an LMA agreement looks like this:

> _"Consolidated EBITDA means operating profit before deducting interest or tax, after adding back depreciation, amortization, and Transaction Costs (up to €15M per annum), after adding back Synergies (capped at 20% of Consolidated EBITDA calculated before this add-back)..."_

This creates a **circular reference** that's tricky to implement in Excel.

### Our Solution

The AI converts this automatically into working code:

```python
def calculate_ebitda(operating_profit, depreciation, amortization,
                     transaction_costs, synergies_claimed):
    # Base EBITDA (before synergies)
    base = operating_profit + depreciation + amortization

    # Cap transaction costs at €15M
    allowed_transaction = min(transaction_costs, 15_000_000)
    base += allowed_transaction

    # Synergy cap: 20% of base EBITDA
    synergy_cap = base * 0.20
    allowed_synergies = min(synergies_claimed, synergy_cap)

    return base + allowed_synergies
```

**No more Excel circular reference errors. No more manual cap calculations.**
